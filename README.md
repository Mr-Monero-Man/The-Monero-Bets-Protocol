# The-Monero-Bets-Protocol
__Protocol ManuEl of operation and for various situations__

## Summery
Itâ€™s a game where you bet yes(O) or no(X) on an event an if you are right you win, else you loose and
get nothing. There are some rules of how it works, and is mostly for resolving conflicts and as a guide
to how things work for people that want to use the advanced features.
Just give the game host (Mr_Monero_Man and/or a vendor / key hl) the required data, then pay and
paly. Remember that you have to accept that:
*MONERO BETS IS NOT WHAT YOU* Decide or Interpret it to be, except if it is the same as what is
written in this document, for this version of monero bets.
The Rules of *MONERO BETS IS* what is written in this Document, and the listing ONLY!
Because that is the only thing being offered in *MONERO BETS*. Thank you for playing!!
